Executive Summary: 
    Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Created labels  column ‘class’ which classifies successful landings.
    Explored data using SQL,  visualization, folium maps, and dashboards. Gathered relevant columns to be used as  features.
    Changed all categorical variables to binary using one hot encoding.  
    Standardized data and used GridSearchCV to find best parameters for machine learning  models. Visualize accuracy score of all models.

  Four machine learning models were produced: 
  Logistic Regression, Support Vector  Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors.
  All produced similar results  with accuracy rate of about 83.33%. All models over predicted successful landings.
  More  data is needed for better model determination and accuracy.

Introduction: 
    Background:
    Commercial Space Age is Here
    Space X has best pricing ($62 million vs. $165 million USD)
    Largely due to ability to recover part of rocket (Stage 1)
    Space Y wants to compete with Space X


    Problem:
    Space Y tasks us to train a machine learning model to  predict successful Stage 1 recovery

Methodology:
